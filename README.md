#Git Practice

This repository is part of my journey to master Git, Github, and the command line - from scratch

## What I've Learned So Far

- Initializing a Git repo ('git init')
- Staging and committing changes
- Connecting to GitHub using SSH
- Cloning repositories ('git clone')
- Pulling updates from remote ('git pull')
- Creating and merging branches ('git branch', 'git checkout', 'git merge')
- Clearning up branches
- Pushing changes to GitHub ('git push')

## Why This Repo Exists

To build muslce memory with Git and develop the core workflow every developer should know.

## What's Next

I'm moving on to:

- More advanced branching (merge conflicts, rebasing)
- Git CTF-style forensics
- Collaboration simulations

Learning Git is like learning chess: easy to start, takes time to master. I'm doing it the right way.
